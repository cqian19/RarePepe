# :frog: Rare Pepe
A website that allows you to upload images of rare Pepes, which can't be copied or stolen! Made during the Bad Hax hackathon December 2015.

## How It Works:
Upload all your rare frogs onto the website. Whenever someone tries to right click your Pepes and save them, an image displaying the words "RARE!" will appear on their cursor instead. Your Pepes' values are preserved, thanks to RarePepe.
